# Forzeit Vue3 Admin Dashboard (Frontend Demo)

This is a **frontend-only admin dashboard** built with **Vue 3 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS**.  
It visualizes key Forzeit metrics using **charts and cards** with fake/live simulated data.  

The dashboard showcases:

- **Active users (last 5s)** – live counter simulated in real time  
- **Users active in the last 24h** – rolling 24h simulated data  
- **Cards created (last 24h)** – event count simulated  
- **Monthly KPIs** – Unique visitors, Trial signups, Paid subscriptions, MRR & ARR  
- **Charts** – Line & Bar charts for visualization  
- **Extra cards** – Notes, Accessibility, and Performance highlights  

This project was created as a **frontend exercise for Forzeit** and does not require a backend.
